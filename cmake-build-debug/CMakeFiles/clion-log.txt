CMake Error at GMDSCEA/CMakeLists.txt:36 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgmds.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gmds", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gmds" with any of
  the following names:

    gmdsConfig.cmake
    gmds-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gmds" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gmds_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gmds"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
